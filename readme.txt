This plugin automates setting up 1-to-1 mapping between Blogger.com (blogspot) blog posts and your new WordPress blog posts. 

== Description ==

Forked from [blogger-to-wordpress-redirection plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/blogger-to-wordpress-redirection/) for personal use.

This plugin is likely not to be maintained, so if you require that, I'd suggest checking out the above plugin.
All of that said, here's the initial description:

If you have imported posts from Blogger.com (blogspot.com) then you might be redirecting visitors from your blog to homepage of your new WordPress blog. Which is wrong, as a user may feel lost when we lands up on your homepage unexpectedly.

This plugin handles traffic redirection part in a way that visitors will see be redirected from old Blogger.com post to same post on new WordPress.com blog on 1-to-1 basis.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q. Plugin gives error - "Sorry No posts found that were imported from a Blogger.com blog". I really have posts imported from Blogger.com**

A. Plugin uses some metadata generated by WordPress' own Blogger.com importer.
If you have used any other way to import your posts from Blogger.com, this plugin will not work.
